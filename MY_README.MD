### Files uploaded
* MY_README.txt - this file
* plot1..4.png - plot results
* plot1..4.R - R code which prepares the result files
* plot_prepare.R - pre-processor code that prepares the subset data for plotting
* plotdata.txt - input file created by plot_prepare.R and used by plot1..4.R codes

### Explanation

* "plot_prepare.R" was used to extract the necessary data (file: plotdata.txt) for plotting. 
* In order to run plotting successfully you only need the "plotdata.txt". Each plot codes start with reading the content of this file.
* For those who want to check how the plotting dataset was achieved, the transformation from the original data to the "plotdata.txt" has also been uploaded.
